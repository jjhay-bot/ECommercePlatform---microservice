# Entity Framework Core: Quick Reference for Microservice APIs

This guide summarizes the most important classes and features from `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` that you'll use when building .NET microservice APIs.

---

## 1. DbContext

**What:**
- The main class for interacting with your database.
- You create your own context by inheriting from this (e.g., `ProductContext`).

**Usage:**
- Manages database connections, tracks changes, and handles CRUD operations.

---

## 2. DbSet<T>

**What:**
- Represents a table in your database for a specific entity type (e.g., `DbSet<Product>`).

**Usage:**
- Used to query and save instances of entities.

---

## 3. DbContextOptions<TContext>

**What:**
- Configuration options for your `DbContext` (e.g., connection string, provider).

**Usage:**
- Passed into your context's constructor.

---

## 4. Migration Classes

**What:**
- Used for database schema changes (migrations).

**Usage:**
- Generated by EF Core tools to update your database structure.

---

## 5. LINQ Query Extensions

**What:**
- Methods like `.Where()`, `.FirstOrDefault()`, `.ToListAsync()` for querying data.

**Usage:**
- Used on `DbSet<T>` to filter, sort, and retrieve data.

---

## 6. SaveChanges / SaveChangesAsync

**What:**
- Methods to persist changes to the database.

**Usage:**
- Call after adding, updating, or deleting entities.

---

## 7. ModelBuilder

**What:**
- Used in `OnModelCreating` to configure entity mappings and relationships.

**Usage:**
- Override in your `DbContext` for advanced configuration.

---

## Example Usage

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

public class ProductContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
    // ...
}
```
