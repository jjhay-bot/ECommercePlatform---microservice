# Model Design in a .NET Microservice

Designing your models (entities) is the foundation of a robust microservice. This guide gives you a quick example, best practices, and actionable tips to get started fast.

## üöÄ Quick Example: Product Model

```csharp
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

namespace ProductCatalogService.Models
{
    public class Product
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        [Required]
        [MaxLength(100)]
        public string Name { get; set; } = default!;
        [MaxLength(500)]
        public string Description { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        [Range(0.01, 10000)]
        public decimal Price { get; set; }
        [Range(0, 1000)]
        public int Stock { get; set; }
        // Example navigation property
        // public int? CategoryId { get; set; }
        // public Category? Category { get; set; }
    }
}
```

> **Why start with models?**
> 
> Models define your data structure and drive your database, API, and business logic. Good models = easier code everywhere else!

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ When to Create Models
- Before creating your DbContext or controllers
- When you need to define what data your service will manage

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Where to Place Models
- In a `Models/` folder in your service project
- One `.cs` file per entity (e.g., `Product.cs`, `User.cs`)

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How to Define a Model
- Use a C# class with properties for each field
- Add data annotations for validation and constraints
- Add navigation properties for relationships (if needed)

---

## üí° Model Design Best Practices
- Use **meaningful property names**
- Use **appropriate data types**
- Add **validation attributes** for required fields, length, and ranges
- Keep models focused on **data only** (no business logic)
- Add navigation properties for relationships (optional)

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Checklist
- [ ] Model class created in `Models/`
- [ ] Properties defined with correct types
- [ ] Validation attributes added
- [ ] Navigation properties (if needed)
- [ ] Referenced in your DbContext

---

## Next Steps
- Reference your models in your DbContext (e.g., `DbSet<Product> Products`)
- Use models in your controllers for CRUD operations
